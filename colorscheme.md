# Color scheme for (possibly) future website
1. **Primary Colors**:
   - **Dark Blue (08405e)**: This should be the primary background color for the website, given its dark and muted tone. It will serve as a neutral backdrop, making the other colors stand out and ensuring readability.

2. **Secondary Colors**:
   - **Purple (6037bb)**: Use this as a secondary color for elements like headers, sub-headings, or navigation bar highlights. It's vibrant enough to draw attention but not so much that it overwhelms the viewer.
   - **Blue (018fcf)**: This can be used for interactive elements like buttons, links, or hover effects. Given its bright and inviting shade, it will indicate interactivity and draw the user's attention.

3. **Accent Colors**:
   - **White (ffffff)**: This should primarily be used for text, icons, and other minor details. Against a dark background, white text is highly readable. Additionally, the website can use white for borders or separators to create contrast and delineate different sections of the site.
