# Halite roadmap
### 1. **Core Language Features:**
   - **Paradigm:** Procedural with prototypal inheritance.
   - **Syntax:** Minimalist and simple for readability.
   - **Type System:** Strong, static, with optional type inference.
   - **Memory Management:** Garbage collected.
   - **Concurrency:** Parallelism-focused for high performance.

### 2. **Syntax Specifics:**
   - **Function Definition and Call:** Using `func` keyword for function definitions, with named arguments to allow any order of arguments during function calls.
   - **Prototype Definition and Inheritance:** Using `prototype` and `extends` keywords for prototype definitions and inheritance respectively.
   - **Method Call:** Methods called on objects using the dot (`.`) operator.
   - **Default Argument Values:** Specified using equals sign (`=`) followed by the default value.
   - **String Interpolation:** Enabled with a dollar sign (`$`) prefix and curly braces (`{}`) for variables and expressions.

### 3. **Parallelism:**
   - **Fiber Definition and Control:** `fiber` keyword to denote coroutines, with `await` for asynchronous operations and `resume()` method to control execution.

### 4. **Module System:**
   - **Importing and Exporting:** Explicit imports and exports using `import` and `export` keywords respectively. Aliasing and selective importing for flexibility.
   - **Module Resolution:** File-based and folder-based modules with a system for path resolution and package management.

### 5. **Standard Library:**
   - **Extensive but Modular:** Providing a wide range of functionality while allowing users to only include what they need.

### 6. **Error Handling:**
   - **Python-like Error Handling:** Using a `try-catch` mechanism.

### 7. **Tooling:**
   - **Debugging and Profiling:** Essential tools for debugging and profiling included.
   - **Build Systems:** Multiple build systems for easy library management, possibly with a tool similar to `rustup`.
   - **Package Management:** A mechanism to easily download and manage third-party libraries.

### 8. **Interoperability:**
   - **Transpilation:** Allowing transpilation to other languages for broader usability.

### 9. **Deployment:**
   - **Standalone Executables:** Targeting standalone executable deployment.

### 10. **Community and Ecosystem:**
- **Community-Driven:** Fostering a community-driven ecosystem for library development and support.

### 11. **Compiler:**
- **Implementation:** The compiler will be implemented in JavaScript on Bun, with PEG.js.
